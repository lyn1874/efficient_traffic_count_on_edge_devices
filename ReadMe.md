### Efficient Multiple traffic modalities counting

The goal of this repository is to count multiple traffic modalities (car, truck, pedestrians, and cyclists) with a model that is as small as possible while maintaining high accuracy. 

Our counting framework follows detecting, tracking, and counting as shown in the figure below:

TODO

- [x] traffic counting tutorial on youtube video
- [ ] update clean code
- [ ] deploy it on edge device, report inference speed
