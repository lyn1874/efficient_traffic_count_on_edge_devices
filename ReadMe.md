### Efficient Multiple traffic modalities counting

The goal of this repository is to count multiple traffic modalities (car, truck, pedestrians, and cyclists) with a model that is as small as possible while maintaining high accuracy. 

Our counting framework follows detecting, tracking, and counting as shown in the figure below:

##### Detail

- The surveillance video that I used in the tutorial is taken from YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNn9qKG2UFI&t=6s). The counting result is at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A6RzYPutqLcP8w5-IJFAhhzV4mUuzcpq/view?usp=sharing

##### TODO
- [x] traffic counting tutorial 
- [ ] update clean code
- [ ] deploy it on the edge device, report the inference speed
